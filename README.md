    Play around a bit and try some new locations.

Any errors you might encounter:
- The program requires a response for each category to run. Although the    country might be obvious or repetitive, you will be prompted to enter one if you try to run the program without one. 

Quick intro on the API:
- to use the API make a hidden file with the API key. Then, import the API into your main file like so:
    url = f"http://api.airvisual.com/v2/countries?key={AIRVISUAL_API_KEY}"
- then create a list using data from the API:
    countries_dict_list = data['data']
    countries_lst = [country_dict ['country'] for country_dict in countries_dict_list]
- pull the info for state and city as well, and tie it to the user responses
- then, you will be able to grab weather data using this info
    weather_info = data['data']['current']['weather']
    additional info can be grabbed from the API using this process:
        a_temperature = int(weather_info.get('tp', 'N/A'))

Limitations/Caveats:
- I had originally wanted to include historical AQI info. My API would not allow this and I could not find a free API that would. If I were to keep working on this project I would try to make this happen
